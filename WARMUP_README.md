# SNAC Model Warmup

This document explains the SNAC warmup functionality added to eliminate cold start penalties in your TTS system.

## Problem Solved

**Cold Start Issue Identified:**
- First SNAC decode: **503.57ms** ‚ùå 
- Subsequent decodes: **5-14ms** ‚úÖ
- **500ms penalty** on every first request!

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Warmup on Import**
The SNAC model is automatically warmed up when `decoder.py` is imported:

```python
# Automatically warm up the model on import
if os.getenv("ENABLE_SNAC_WARMUP", "true").lower() == "true":
    warmup_snac_model()
```

### 2. **Explicit Warmup Method**
Added `warmup_models()` method to `OrpheusModelTRT`:

```python
model = OrpheusModelTRT()
model.warmup_models()  # Warms up both LLM and SNAC
```

### 3. **Application Startup Integration**
Warmup is automatically called during FastAPI startup in `main.py`:

```python
engine = OrpheusModelTRT()
engine.warmup_models()  # Eliminates cold start for all requests
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ENABLE_SNAC_WARMUP=true` (default): Auto-warmup on import
- `ENABLE_SNAC_WARMUP=false`: Disable auto-warmup

### Manual Control

```python
# Disable auto-warmup
os.environ["ENABLE_SNAC_WARMUP"] = "false"

# Import and warmup manually
from src.trt_engine import OrpheusModelTRT
model = OrpheusModelTRT()
model.warmup_models()
```

## Expected Performance Impact

### Before Warmup:
- **First request**: 500ms+ cold start penalty
- **RTF**: ~0.99 (artificially inflated by cold start)
- **TTFB**: 715ms+ (dominated by SNAC warmup)

### After Warmup:
- **First request**: 5-14ms (normal performance)
- **RTF**: Expected ~0.5-0.7 (2x improvement!)
- **TTFB**: <100ms (much more responsive)

## Testing

### Run Warmup Demo
```bash
python warmup_demo.py
```

This script demonstrates the performance difference with and without warmup.

### Profiling with Warmup
```bash
python profiling_example.py
```

This runs profiling with warmup enabled to show optimal performance metrics.

### Production Usage
Your application automatically includes warmup in the startup sequence, so no additional configuration is needed.

## Monitoring

Check your logs for warmup confirmation:
```
üî• Starting SNAC model warmup...
‚úÖ SNAC model warmup completed in XXX.XXms
üöÄ Models are now ready for optimal performance!
```

The warmup typically takes the same time as the original cold start (400-600ms), but it happens once during startup rather than on every first request.

## Troubleshooting

If warmup fails, the system will still work but with cold start penalties:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  SNAC warmup failed after XXX.XXms: [error]
Model will still work but first inference will be slower
```

Common issues:
- Insufficient GPU memory
- CUDA/PyTorch environment issues  
- Model loading problems

The warmup is designed to fail gracefully - your TTS system will work normally even if warmup fails, just with the original cold start behavior.
